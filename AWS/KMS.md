# Key Management Service

- Regional and Public Service (AWS public zone)
- create, store and manage keys
- symmetric and asymmetric keys
- cryptographic operations (encrypt, decrypt, ...)
- keys never leave KMS
- complies with FIPS 140-2 L2

`Customer Master Key : CMK`
- isolated to a region
- AWS Managed CMK
  - created automatically by AWS when a service that uses encryption is used
  - rotates every 3 years
- Customer Managed CMK
  - created explicitly by customer
  - configurable through key policies
  - rotation is optional, 1 year cycles
- alias : shortcut to a particular CMK, scoped per region
- used by user and application in encryption operations
- container for actual physical master keys
  - logical : ID, date, policy, desc & state
  - backed by physical key material
    - generated or imported
  - used for up to 4KB of data

`Key Policies`
- KMS has to be explicitly told that keys trust the aws account they are in
- key trust accounts, which then allows account to manage it by applying iam permission policies to iam users in the account
- can grant one group the ability to create keys, and others to use them, at different granularity's for role separation


`Data Encryption Keys : DEKs`
- generated by KMS using CMK
- used to encrypt data larger than 4kb
- steps
  - kms create two version of dek
    - a plaintext and a cipher-text version 
    - cipher-text version is encrypted by a CMK that can eventually decrypt it
  - plaintext version is used to encrypt data and is immediately discarded
  - encrypted data and key are then stored side-by-side
  - send encrypted key to KMS that decrypts it with the same CMK that created it
  - then use the newly decrypted key to decrypt that data
  - discard the data encrypted key

## Encryption Approaches

Encryption at Rest
- protect data while it is being stored

Encryption in Transit
- protect data while it is being transferred
- sender encrypts data before sending, receiver decrypts when it receives

- Plaintext : Un-encrypted data
- Algorithm : code that takes plain text and an encryption key to generate encrypted data
- Key : password
- Cipher text : encrypted data that is created by an algorithm taking a key and plaintext

Symmetric Encryption
- same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data

Asymmetric Encryption
- public and private key
- public encrypts but cannot decrypt, private key decrypts
- more computationally difficult than symmetric
  - sometimes used to initially agree on a symmetric key, and then the symmetric key is used 

Signing
- used to prove identity
- sender signs message with his private key
  - receiver can use sender public key to verify that the private key was used to sign the message

Steganography
- used to hide the fact that encryption was used
- cipher text is embedded in another plaintext data that serves as a medium of transportation
