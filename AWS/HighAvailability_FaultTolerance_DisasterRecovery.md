# High-Availability (HA)

- `ensure` an agreed level of operational performance, `usually uptime`
- about `minimizing outages`
- can be achieved with having standby servers that are automated to be used when issues on main servers appear
- not as good as `FT`
- 
# Fault-Tolerance (FT)

- enable a system to `continue operating properly` in the event of the `failure of some` of its `components` 
- about `operating through failure`
- can be achieved with `redundancy` and ability to `route around failures`
- harder and more expensive than  `HA`

# Disaster Recovery

- enable the `recovery of vital technology` following a natural or human-induced `disaster`
- involves `pre-planning` and the `DR Process`
- taking regular offsite backups
- logins and keys and process should be saved
