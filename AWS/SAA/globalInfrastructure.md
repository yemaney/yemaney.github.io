# Global Infrastructure

## Regions

- Geographic Separation - isolated Fault Domain
- Geopolitical Separation - Different governance
- Location Control - Performance

## Availability Zone (AZ)

- one or more isolated data centers infrastructure within a region
- connected with high speed low-latency

## Service Resilience

`Global resilient`
- globally available, ie Iam

`Region Resilient`
- run in a single region
- generally replicate data across AZ

`AZ Resilient`
- run in a single AZ

## Local Zones

- infrastructure placed close to large population and industry centers
- used to reduce distance of datacenter for `low latency`
- 1 zones, `no built int resilience`
- not all products supported
- `support DX`
- use for the highest performance
