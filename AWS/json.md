# JSON

An object is an unordered set of `key : value` pairs. (dictionary)
An array is an ordered collection of values separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets. (list)

```json
{
    "string": "cat",
    "number": 323,
    "boolean" : true,
    "null" : null,
    "array" : [1,2,3],
    "object" : {
        "key" : "value"
    } 
}
```
