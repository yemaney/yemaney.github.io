    "In particular, in the context of languages with first-class functions, Norvig suggests rethinking the `Strategy, Command, Template Method, and Visitor patterns`. The general idea is: `you can replace instances of some participant class in these patterns with simple functions`, reducing a lot of boilerplate code. In this chapter, we will refactor Strategy using function objects, and discuss a similar approach to simplifying the Command pattern."

    "- Customers with 1,000 or more fidelity points get a global 5% discount per order\n",
    "- A 10% discount is applied to each line item with 20 or more units in the same order\n",

    "In many cases, functions or callable objects provide a more natural way of implementing callbacks in Python than mimicking the Strategy or the Command patterns as described by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides. The refactoring of Strategy and the discussionof Command in this chapter are examples of a more general insight: sometimes you may encounter a design pattern or an API that requires that components implement an\n",
    "interface with a single method, and that method has a generic-sounding name such as “execute”, “run”, or “doIt”. Such patterns or APIs often can be implemented with less boilerplate code in Python using first-class functions or other callables. The message from Peter Norvig’s design patterns slides is that the Command and Strategy patterns—along with Template Method and Visitor—can be made simpler or even “invisible” with first-class functions, at least for some applications of these patterns."
