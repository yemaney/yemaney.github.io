This happens because a hash function maps arbitrary objects to a small number of bits, and—in addition—the hash table is indexed with a subset of those bits. In order to resolve the collision, the algorithm then takes different bits in the hash, massages them in a particular way, and uses the result as an offset to look up a different bucket.

Additionally, when inserting items, Python may determine that the hash table is too crowded and rebuild it to a new location with more room. As the hash table grows, so does the number of hash bits used as bucket offsets, and this keeps the rate of collisions low."

    "Dictionaries are a keystone of Python. Beyond the basic dict, the standard library offers handy, ready-to-use specialized mappings like defaultdict, OrderedDict, ChainMap, and Counter, all defined in the collections module. The same module also provides the easy-to-extend UserDict class\n",
    "\n",
    "Two powerful methods available in most mappings are setdefault and update. The setdefault method is used to update items holding mutable values, for example, in a dict of list values, to avoid redundant searches for the same key. The update method allows bulk insertion or overwriting of items from any other mapping, from iterables providing (key, value) pairs and from keyword arguments. Mapping constructors also use update internally, allowing instances to be initialized from mappings, iterables, or keyword arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "A clever hook in the mapping API is the `__missing__` method, which lets you customize what happens when a key is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collections.abc module provides the Mapping and MutableMapping abstract base classes for reference and type checking. The little-known MappingProxyType from the types module creates immutable mappings. There are also ABCs for Set and Mutable Set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash table implementation underlying dict and set is extremely fast. Understanding its logic explains why items are apparently unordered and may even be reordered behind our backs. There is a price to pay for all this speed, and the price is in memory"
