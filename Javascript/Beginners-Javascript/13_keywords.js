// difference between var, let, and const 
// let won't let you declare the same variable more than once
// let is limited to the scope it is defined in
// var is global scope
// const makes read only variable declarations
// const array can still be mutated
// const object can be mutated
// can use object.freeze(object) instead prevent mutation
